Why another whois client? Because the ripe client is a mess of hacks and
#ifdefs and more complex programs lack features or are bloated.

Notes on the data files:
- domain names MUST be lowercase and MUST begin with "." or "-".
- first match wins (for both domains and netblocks)
- elements in tld_serv_list are matched against the end of the query


Delegation data has been gathered by me.
TLD whois data has been borrowed from various sources, mostly the whois
proxy at www.geektools.org and the awhois script by Greg Woods.

Please send me any information you have regarding domains and netblocks
not correctly handled by the program.

Please also try to compile after defining HAVE_GETADDRINFO and send me
working #defines for your flavour of UNIX.

The home of the program is http://www.linux.it/~md/software/
